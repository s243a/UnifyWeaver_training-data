Returns the top N most relevant results based on cosine similarity\n\nThe semantic runtime also supports RDF/XML crawling with `crawler_run/2`, which automatically generates embeddings for discovered content. During crawling, RDF attributes become `@rdf:about` fields, text content maps to `text` fields, and nested elements become structured objects.\n\nTo use semantic search in Go target code, you need an ONNX model file (like `models/model.onnx`) and the ONNX Runtime dependency.
