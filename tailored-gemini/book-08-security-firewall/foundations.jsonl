The system uses a specialized firewall at compile-time to enforce module whitelisting, capability controls, and target language restrictions. Deployment-level security focuses on authentication, encryption, and location validation, while runtime security provides resilience through circuit breakers, retry policies, and audit monitoring. The firewall serves as the primary gateway, auditing everything from dialect selection to module imports during the build process.

Guidance mode is the default setting; it permits operations while issuing warnings for policy violations, making it suitable for development. Enforce mode is designed for production and actively blocks any actions that violate security policies. Audit mode allows all operations to proceed but records every action in a log for compliance and auditing.
