{"cluster_id": "security-001", "question": "What are the main security threats in code generation systems?", "answer": "Code generation systems face five key threats: (1) Arbitrary execution - generated code performs unintended operations, (2) Resource access - scripts accessing files/network/system, (3) Dialect capabilities - some targets have dangerous features like native compilation, (4) Compilation security - compiled binaries are harder to audit, (5) Cross-target leakage - secrets flowing between pipeline stages. UnifyWeaver addresses these with defense in depth across compile-time, deployment, and runtime layers.", "source_file": "book-08-security-firewall/01_introduction.md", "prerequisites": ["book-01-foundations"]}
{"cluster_id": "security-001", "question": "How does UnifyWeaver's security architecture work?", "answer": "UnifyWeaver provides defense in depth across three layers: (1) Compile-time security with firewall policy evaluation controlling target restrictions, module whitelisting, and capability control; (2) Deployment security with service configuration enforcing encryption, location validation, and authentication; (3) Runtime security with circuit breakers, retry policies, fallback mechanisms, and monitoring/audit. The firewall is the primary compile-time mechanism that checks at target selection, dialect selection, compilation control, and module imports.", "source_file": "book-08-security-firewall/01_introduction.md", "prerequisites": ["book-01-foundations"]}
{"cluster_id": "security-002", "question": "What are the three firewall operating modes?", "answer": "UnifyWeaver's firewall has three modes: (1) Guidance mode (default) - warns but allows operations, suitable for development; (2) Enforce mode - blocks policy violations, suitable for production; (3) Audit mode - allows but logs everything, suitable for compliance. Set mode with `:- firewall_mode(enforce).` in the .firewall file.", "source_file": "book-08-security-firewall/01_introduction.md", "prerequisites": ["book-01-foundations"]}
{"cluster_id": "security-002", "question": "What does the firewall system control?", "answer": "The firewall controls five key areas: (1) Target selection - allow/deny specific compilation targets like bash, go, python; (2) Dialect selection - allow/deny Prolog dialects like SWI or GNU Prolog; (3) Module imports - block network libraries, database access; (4) Compilation - prevent native binary compilation; (5) Capabilities - disable file write, network access. Policies are declared in .firewall files using Prolog syntax.", "source_file": "book-08-security-firewall/01_introduction.md", "prerequisites": ["book-01-foundations"]}
