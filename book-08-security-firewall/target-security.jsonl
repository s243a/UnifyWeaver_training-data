{"cluster_id": "target-sec-001", "question": "What are the security risks with Bash target?", "answer": "Bash has four main risks: (1) Command injection - user input in commands; (2) Shell expansion - glob and variable expansion; (3) Privilege escalation - sudo/setuid; (4) Path manipulation - PATH injection. Mitigation: Use strict quoting, `set -euo pipefail`, absolute paths, never use eval. UnifyWeaver generates safe Bash with these protections by default:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -euo pipefail\ninput=\"${1:-}\"  # Variables always quoted\nresult=$((input * 2))  # Safe arithmetic\n```", "source_file": "book-08-security-firewall/04_target_security.md", "prerequisites": ["target-sec-001"]}

{"cluster_id": "target-sec-002", "question": "Which target is best for production security?", "answer": "Go and Rust are best for production: Go offers high compile-time safety, static typing, no eval, memory safety, and compile-time imports preventing hijacking. Rust provides very high safety with guaranteed memory safety, no null pointers, no data races, and minimal attack surface. Use Bash only for development, Python for controlled environments with import restrictions. C#/.NET is good for enterprise with CLR sandbox and Code Access Security.", "source_file": "book-08-security-firewall/04_target_security.md", "prerequisites": ["target-sec-001"]}
