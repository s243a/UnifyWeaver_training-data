It uses Prolog as a high-level language to define data relationships, rules, and queries, then compiles these into optimized code for your chosen target.\n\n## How It Works\n\nYou define predicates in Prolog:\n\n```prolog\n% Define facts\nparent(alice, bob).\nparent(bob, charlie).\n\n% Define rules\nancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).\nancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).\n```\n\nThen compile to your target language:\n\n```prolog\n?- use_module(unifyweaver(core/compiler_driver)).\n?- compile(ancestor/2, [target(bash)], Scripts).\n```\n\nThis generates optimized Bash code with BFS traversal, memoization, and cycle detection.\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nUnifyWeaver addresses common complexity issues:\n- **Repetitive boilerplate** - Define logic once, generate for multiple targets\n- **Inconsistent data handling** - Single source of truth in Prolog\n- **Hidden dependencies** - Prolog makes relationships explicit\n- **Maintenance nightmares** - Change Prolog, regenerate all targets\n\nUnifyWeaver is NOT a Prolog interpreter - it's a compiler that translates Prolog specifications into native code for the target platform.", "anchor_question_hash": "f7662002625737f7"}}
