There are four basic types:\n\n## 1. Atoms\n\nAtoms are constant names starting with lowercase (or quoted):\n\n```prolog\nalice\nbob\nparent\n'Starts with capital'\n'has spaces'\n```\n\n## 2. Numbers\n\n```prolog\n42\n-100\n3.14\n```\n\n## 3. Variables\n\nVariables start with uppercase or underscore. They are placeholders for unknown values:\n\n```prolog\nX\nParent\nFileName\n_              % Anonymous variable (don't care about value)\n_Unused        % Named but ignored\n```\n\n## 4. Complex Terms (Structures)\n\nA structure has a **functor** (name) and **arguments**:\n\n```prolog\nparent(alice, bob)          % functor: parent, arity: 2\nfile('main.c', 1024)        % functor: file, arity: 2\npoint(X, Y, Z)              % functor: point, arity: 3\n```\n\n## Arity\n\nThe **arity** is the number of arguments. We write `functor/arity`:\n\n```prolog\nparent/2      % parent with 2 arguments\nfile/3        % file with 3 arguments\nhello/0       % hello with no arguments (same as atom)\n```\n\nTwo predicates with the same name but different arity are **different predicates**:\n\n```prolog\nconnect(A, B).        % connect/2\nconnect(A, B, Port).  % connect/3 - different predicate!\n```", "anchor_question_hash": "4ddb304f4bc98f3b"}}
