In Prolog, every piece of data is a term, which can be classified into four distinct types:\n\n1.  **Atoms**: Constant names that typically start with a lowercase letter (like `alice` or `parent`) or are enclosed in single quotes (like `'Has Spaces'`).\n2.  **Numbers**: Standard integers and floating-point values (e.g., `42`, `-100`, `3.14`).\n3.  **Variables**: Placeholders for values that start with an uppercase letter or an underscore (e.g., `X`, `Person`, `_`). The single underscore `_` is the anonymous variable, used when the value does not need to be tracked or named.\n4.  **Complex Terms (Structures)**: These consist of a **functor** (the name) followed by a set of **arguments**. For example, `parent(alice, bob)` is a structure where `parent` is the functor with two arguments.\n\nA key concept for complex terms is **arity**, which is the total number of arguments a structure contains. This is represented using the notation `functor/arity` (e.g., `parent/2`). It is important to note that Prolog treats predicates with the same name but different arities (such as `connect/2` and `connect/3`) as entirely distinct entities.\n\nFor a deeper dive into these foundational concepts, see `education/book-01-foundations/02_prolog_fundamentals.md`.", "answer_variant": "default", "answer_source": "education/book-01-foundations/02_prolog_fundamentals.md", "topics": ["prolog", "terms", "atoms", "variables", "structures", "arity"], "original_answer": "In Prolog, everything is built from **terms**.
