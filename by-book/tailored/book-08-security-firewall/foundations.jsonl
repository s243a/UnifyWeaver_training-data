{"pair_id": "security-001_p0", "cluster_id": "security-001", "question": "How does UnifyWeaver's security architecture work?", "question_type": "medium", "answer": "UnifyWeaver's security architecture implements a three-tier defense-in-depth model. At the compile level, the firewall subsystem enforces policy-based restrictions on target selection, whitelists approved modules, and controls capability access. During deployment, service configurations mandate encryption requirements, validate execution locations, and handle authentication protocols. At runtime, the system employs circuit breakers for fault isolation, retry policies for resilience, fallback strategies for degraded operation, and comprehensive monitoring with audit logging. The firewall serves as the cornerstone of compile-time protection, intercepting and validating decisions at target selection, dialect choice, compilation phases, and module import boundaries.
